# DHVANI - Audio Classification and Motor Actuator
This is the repository for all of the software that I developed and contributed for the sound installation Dhvani, developed by [Budhaditya Chattopadihay](https://budhaditya.org/projects/connecting-resonances/dhvani/)


> Dhvāni is a series of responsive, self-regulating, and autonomous installations driven by Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning that advocates for the values of interconnectivity, codependence, network, and community with a decolonial approach. Dhvāni incorporates ritual and traditional practices from South Asia, e.g. temple bells, Buddhist Gongs, wind chimes, and Ghungroo, among others, to bring new perspectives into interactive media arts.
